### OVERVIEW
I am an M.A. student in the School of Journalism and Communication at Chongqing University, where my research focuses on the emotional and cognitive processes that individuals undergo when confronted with climate change risks. Specifically, I investigate **transilience**, **efficacy beliefs**, and **climate change anxiety**, with the goal of mitigating the negative impacts, fostering psychological resilience, and promoting human well-being in response to climate change.
