<div id="describe-text">
	<p>I am <b>Penghui Tao</b>, an M.A. student in the School of Journalism and Communication at Chongqing University. I am a recipient of the 2023-2024 Chinese National Scholarship. My research focuses on the <b>emotional and cognitive processes individuals experience when facing climate change risks</b>, including transilience, efficacy beliefs, and climate change anxiety. I conduct theory-driven, evidence-based research to mitigate the negative outcomes of climate change, foster psychological resilience, and enhance human well-being.</p>

<p>My research encompasses two primary themes: 1) exploring <b>positive and resilient perspectives</b> on climate change risks, and 2) examining how <b>emotions dynamically shape individual information behaviors</b> in the context of climate change. My work has been published in <i>Current Psychology</i>, a peer-reviewed journal indexed in the SSCI. Methodologically, I primarily use <b>quantitative approaches</b>, such as web-based experiments and <b>longitudinal panel surveys</b>, to draw causal inferences. My analyses involve <b>advanced statistical techniques</b>, including exploratory graph analysis, longitudinal panel analysis, and structural equation modeling.</p>
