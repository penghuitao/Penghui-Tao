<div id="describe-text">
	<p align="left">I am <b>Penghui Tao</b>, an M.A. student in the School of Journalism and Communication at <b>Chongqing University</b>. I am a recipient of the 2023-2024 <b>Chinese National Scholarship</b>. My research focuses on the <b>emotional and cognitive processes individuals experience when facing climate change risks</b>, including transilience, efficacy beliefs, and climate change anxiety. I conduct theory-driven, evidence-based research to <b>mitigate the negative impacts of climate change, foster psychological resilience, and enhance human well-being.</b></p>

<p align="left">My research encompasses two primary themes: 1) exploring <b>positive and resilient perspectives</b> on coping with climate change risks, and 2) examining how <b>emotions dynamically shape information behaviors</b> in the context of climate change. My work has been published in <b><i>Current Psychology</i></b>, a peer-reviewed journal indexed in the SSCI. Methodologically, I primarily use <b>quantitative approaches</b>, such as <b>web-based experiments</b> and <b>longitudinal panel surveys</b>, to draw causal inferences. My analyses involve <b>advanced statistical techniques</b>, including exploratory graph analysis, longitudinal panel analysis, and structural equation modeling.</p>

<p align="left">I grew up in a beautiful town nestled within one of China’s vast national forest parks, which inspired my lifelong love for nature. In my free time, I enjoy <b>hiking, meditating, and spending time with animals</b>. My profile picture features a red panda <b><i>(Ailurus fulgens)</i></b>, an animal I find absolutely adorable! Since red pandas are a <b>protected species</b> in China, I can’t have one as a pet, but I share my home with a <b>dog, a cat, and a parrot</b>, all of whom I adore.</p>
