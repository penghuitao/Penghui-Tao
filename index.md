	<p>Hello! I am <strong>Penghui Tao</strong>, an M.A. student in the <strong>School of Journalism and Communication</strong> at <strong>Chongqing University</strong>. I am honored to be a recipient of the <strong>2023-2024 Chinese National Scholarship</strong>. My research is dedicated to understanding the <strong>emotional and cognitive processes individuals experience when confronting climate change risks</strong>. Specifically, I focus on <strong>transilience</strong>, <strong>efficacy beliefs</strong>, and <strong>climate change anxiety</strong>—key factors that influence how we respond to climate change information and the psychological challenges it presents.</p>
        
        <p>I aim to conduct <strong>theory-driven, evidence-based research</strong> that not only explores how to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change but also fosters psychological resilience and promotes human well-being. My work touches on two main themes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exploring Positive and Resilient Coping Strategies</strong>: How can we cope with the psychological challenges posed by climate change risks in a way that strengthens resilience?</li>
            <li><strong>The Dynamic Role of Emotions in Information Behavior</strong>: How do emotions shape the ways individuals process and respond to climate change information, especially in an era of rapid digital media consumption?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I am proud to have had my research published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-024-06864-y"><b><i>Current Psychology</i></b></a>, a peer-reviewed journal indexed in the <strong>SSCI</strong>. Methodologically, my approach is rooted in <strong>quantitative research</strong>, using techniques such as <strong>web-based experiments</strong>, <strong>longitudinal panel surveys</strong>, and <strong>advanced statistical analyses</strong> (e.g., <strong>exploratory graph analysis</strong>, <strong>longitudinal panel analysis</strong>, and <strong>structural equation modeling</strong>) to draw meaningful causal inferences.</p>
        
        <p>I grew up in a beautiful town surrounded by one of China’s vast national forest parks, which ignited my deep passion for nature. When I'm not researching, I enjoy activities like hiking, meditating, and spending time with my beloved animals. My profile picture features a <strong>red panda (Ailurus fulgens)</strong>, an animal I find utterly adorable. Since red pandas are a protected species in China, I can’t have one as a pet, but I share my home with a dog, a cat, and a parrot, each of whom brings joy to my life.</p>
