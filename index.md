<div id="describe-text">
	<p>I am Penghui Tao, an M.A. student in the School of Journalism and Communication at Chongqing University. I am a recipient of the 2023-2024 Chinese National Scholarship. My research focuses on the emotional and cognitive processes individuals experience when facing climate change risks, including transilience, efficacy beliefs, and climate change anxiety. I conduct theory-driven, evidence-based research to mitigate the negative outcomes of climate change, foster psychological resilience, and enhance human well-being.

My research encompasses two primary themes: 1) exploring positive and resilient perspectives on climate change risks, and 2) examining how emotions dynamically shape individual information behaviors in the context of climate change. My work has been published in Current Psychology, a peer-reviewed journal indexed in the SSCI. Methodologically, I primarily use quantitative approaches, such as web-based experiments and longitudinal panel surveys, to draw causal inferences. My analyses involve advanced statistical techniques, including exploratory graph analysis, longitudinal panel analysis, and structural equation modeling.</p>
