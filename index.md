<div id="describe-text">
	<p align="left">I am <b>Penghui Tao</b>, an M.A. student in the School of Journalism and Communication at <b>Chongqing University</b>. I am honored to be a recipient of the 2023-2024 <b>Chinese National Scholarship</b>. My research is dedicated to understanding the <b>emotional and cognitive processes individuals experience when confronting climate change risks</b>. Specifically, I focus on <b>transilience</b>, <b>efficacy beliefs</b>, and <b>climate change anxiety</b>—key factors that influence how we respond to climate change information and the psychological challenges it presents.</p>

<p align="left">I aim to conduct theory-driven, evidence-based research that not only explores how to <b>mitigate the negative impacts of climate change</b> but also <b>fosters psychological resilience</b> and <b>promotes human well-being</b>. My work touches on two main themes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Exploring Positive and Resilient Coping Strategies</b>: How can we cope with the psychological challenges posed by climate change risks in a way that strengthens resilience?</li>
    <li><b>The Dynamic Role of Emotions in Information Behavior</b>: How do emotions shape the ways individuals process and respond to climate change information, especially in an era of rapid digital media consumption?</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">I am proud to have had my research published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-024-06864-y"><b><i>Current Psychology</i></b></a>, a peer-reviewed journal indexed in the SSCI. Methodologically, my approach is rooted in <b>quantitative research</b>, using techniques such as <b>web-based experiments</b>, <b>longitudinal panel surveys</b>, and <b>advanced statistical analyses</b> (e.g., <b>exploratory graph analysis</b>, <b>longitudinal panel analysis</b>, and <b>structural equation modeling</b>) to draw meaningful causal inferences.</p>

<p align="left">I grew up in a beautiful town surrounded by one of China’s vast national forest parks, which ignited my deep passion for nature. When I'm not researching, I enjoy activities like <b>hiking</b>, <b>meditating</b>, and <b>spending time with animals</b>. My profile picture features a <b>red panda <i>(Ailurus fulgens)</i></b>, an animal I find utterly adorable! Since red pandas are a <b>protected species</b> in China, I can’t have one as a pet, but I share my home with a <b>dog</b>, a <b>cat</b>, and a <b>parrot</b>, each of whom brings joy to my life.</p>
