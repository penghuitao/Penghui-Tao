<h2><strong>What is Factor Analysis</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Meaning</strong></h3>
<p>Factor Analysis is a statistical technique that reduces multiple observable variables (i.e., observed variables) that describe an entity into a few unobservable variables (i.e., latent variables, also known as latent factors).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Observed variables</strong>: Variables that can be directly measured. For example, a question in a questionnaire or a dimension score that is directly summed up, without estimating error.</li>
  <li><strong>Latent variables</strong>: These are typically variables that cannot be directly measured, and must be estimated using external measurement indicators. Similar concepts include constructs, traits, and factors.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Example</strong></h3>
<p>For instance, a student's academic ability (latent variable) can be described by their subject scores (observed variables), such as Chinese, Mathematics, and English scores.</p>

<p>Factor analysis explores the internal relationships between numerous variables to uncover the underlying structure of observed variables. It represents the data's fundamental structure using a few meaningful, independent factors. This is why factor analysis is often referred to as a "dimension reduction" technique â€” it uses a few more generalizable factors to reduce the original dimensions. These factors reflect the main information represented by the original observed variables and explain the interdependence between these variables.</p>

<h2><strong>Types of Factor Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>Factor analysis can be divided into two major types: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), depending on whether there is a theoretical foundation before analysis.</p>

<h3><strong>Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)</strong></h3>
<p>EFA is a technique used to identify the inherent structure of multiple observed variables and reduce dimensionality. It is used to explore the dimensional composition of psychological structures.</p>

<h3><strong>Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)</strong></h3>
<p>CFA is used to test whether the relationships between factors and their corresponding measurement items align with the theoretical relationships designed by the researcher. It is used to test theoretical hypotheses about psychological structures.</p>

<p>If the psychological behavior variables are unclear and there is little knowledge about the factors underlying the observed data, EFA can help simplify the data and understand the specific factors included in the psychological behavior variable. If the researcher has already hypothesized the format and structure of the psychological behavior variable based on theory or prior research, CFA can be used to determine whether the observed data truly measure these factors and whether the existing theoretical hypotheses can be validated.</p>

<h2><strong>Theoretical Model Assumptions of Factor Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>Observed indicators (questions, items, survey items) consist of two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Common Factors / Public Factors</strong>: The shared portion of all items or entries.</li>
  <li><strong>Unique Factors</strong>: Factors unique to each item, where there is no correlation between the unique factors of different items.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no correlation between unique factors, and no correlation between unique factors and common factors. The relationship between common factors may be correlated or uncorrelated.</p>

<h3><strong>Key Concepts</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Factor Loading</strong>: The correlation coefficient between the observed variable and the extracted common factor. The square of the factor loading can explain the proportion of variance in the observed variable that is explained by a particular factor.</li>
  <li><strong>Communality</strong>: The percentage of variance in an observed variable explained by common factors. It represents the degree to which the original information in the variable is retained after replacing the variable with the common factors.</li>
  <li><strong>Eigenvalue</strong>: The extent to which a common factor influences each observed variable, reflecting the importance of that common factor.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Purpose</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>To represent a large number of variables with fewer factors.</li>
  <li>To explore and construct the structure of psychological constructs (EFA).</li>
  <li>To test the structural validity of psychological tests (CFA).</li>
</ul>
